PreCheck MyScript

PreCheck MyScript is integrated directly within the
EMR, and it can be used to:

* + Check current prescription coverage and
    out-or pocket cost as member's pharmacy.
  + Get information on lower-cost
    prescriptions alternatives, if
    available, to help save member money.
  + See which prescriptions currently
    require prior authorization or are
    non-covered or non-preferred.
