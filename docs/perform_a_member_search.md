    Provider Information** form
    will open.

    information on the form and then click

  that best suits the patient information they
  have available.   
  **Notes:**
  + If the HCP leaves the **First**or **Last Date of
    Service** field blank, it
    will default to today's date and return
    all policies (past, present, and
    future).
  + When searching for a member, benefits
    load based on the dates listed in the
    **First** and **Last
    Dates of Service** fields.
  + If the HCP needs to view past or future
    benefits, they should input a specific
    date to load the applicable benefits for
    that time frame (i.e., up to six months
    in the past or 12 months in the future).
* Go to Step 5.
